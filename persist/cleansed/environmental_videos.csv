This year marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the first national park in America. This weekend Obama traveled to Carlsbad Caverns and Yosemite, where he surprised a group of 4th-grade students who were visiting Yosemite as part of a White House program that offers free access to national parks for 4th graders and their families.

The hole, which runs along a fault line, appeared after heavy rains in the area. Layers of geological history can be seen on the walls of the hole, including a 60,000-year-old volcanic deposit. Sinkholes are depressions that gradually form in the ground when water erodes an underlying layer of rock or soil.

These tiny sea creatures may have a not-so-tiny effect on the ocean. While it is believed that wind and tidal currents are the primary causes of the mixing of ocean waters ... Scientists at Stanford University discovered zooplankton can also have this effect.

Organisms like krill and brine shrimp swim hundreds of meters up to the surface in groups of billions. These enormous swarms could create powerful currents in the ocean. Previously, scientists believed that zooplankton could only affect the water in their own size range. But the krill in this tank show that, as a group, they can create powerful turbulence. Scientists hope to conduct these studies in the ocean, and the findings could shed light on how animals can influence our climate on land.

Houtong (猴硐), Taiwan is known as ""Cat Village"" (貓村). Once a major coal mining center, the economy here now centers on cat tourism. When mining stopped in early 1990s, Houtong’s population plummeted. But the cat-to-human ratio surged, as some relocated without their pets. Others who remained kept feeding the strays. After a visit to Houtong in 2007, Jian Peiling, aka “Mrs. Kitty,” now a pro cat photographer, organized a volunteer welfare campaign for the felines. There have been unhappy moments. People have stolen cats and abandoned them at Cat Village. Introduced animals raise disease risk. Houtong’s cats do receive vaccinations. And they're all fixed, so a stable cat population reflects an illicit influx. Estimates vary: 100 to 200 cats—equal to or double the human population. Two-legged guests are very welcome. In 2009, Houtong's train station had over a quarter million arrivals—already a tenfold increase over the previous decade. But last year, visits may have topped one million.

UPDATE: Since we filmed this video, the FDA has banned triclosan and 18 other ingredients from “consumer antiseptic wash products” (aka soap). You can read the details below, but the FDA is basically saying that none of these ingredients clean your hands any better than plain old soap and water. The FDA did not ban triclosan from toothpaste, but you can easily check whether your toothpaste has it by checking the ingredients label. Triclosan would be listed under “Active Ingredients” in the “Drug Facts” box on the back of the package. Most toothpastes don’t have triclosan, so you can choose to brush without it if you’d like.

About Ingredients:
Join MIT-trained chemist and science educator George Zaidan as he tries to recreate everyday household products like toothpaste, lipstick, or shaving cream using only natural ingredients… and no recipe! He’ll have to decode long lists of intimidating chemical names, figure out what they all do, try and find natural substitutes, and then cook up the do-it-yourself versions in his chemistry lab (kitchen). While George may or may not succeed, we'll all learn something new and surprising about the products we take for granted every day.

Her ancestors have lived on the land for hundreds of years, and they are now expected to be among the United States’ first climate refugees. Chief Shirell can’t stop the storms, but she is impacting the legacy of her ancestors, the lives of her community today and the future of her people.

National Geographic Presents: IMPACT with Gal Gadot is a six-part documentary short series that follows the powerful stories of six women who are making an extraordinary impact on their communities around the world. Despite living in areas marred by violence, poverty, trauma, discrimination, oppression, and natural disasters, these brave women remain undeterred as they dare to dream, stand out, speak up and lead. The women featured in each short film come from very different backgrounds – across Brazil, Puerto Rico, Michigan, California, Louisiana and Tennessee – yet they are all connected by their unwavering determination and commitment to improving the lives of the people around them.

New episodes release Mondays at 1p ET right here on YouTube.

Now archaeological discoveries and modern DNA analysis are uncovering reality: these women warriors existed. National Geographic History magazine Executive Editor Amy Briggs and historian Adrienne Mayor introduce us to the horse-riding, arrow-flinging women who fought like men—and were feared by them too.

When winter nears, a subdued brown coat turns dazzling white in many—although not all—snowshoe hares. But the camouflage can’t work without snow. And length of daylight, not snowfall, triggers molting. Scott Mills and colleagues at the University of Montana study snowshoe hares from a population in Washington state, where some change color seasonally, and others stay brown all year—better if there’s less snow. The research shows that regions where genes for winter-white and winter-brown coats coexist allow natural selection for new, less snowy conditions. The scientists recommend protecting habitat in these evolutionary hotspots.

Between 1999 and 2015 more than half of the entire island's population disappeared due in part to habitat loss driven by palm oil harvesting and logging. Poaching and human interaction also contributed to the dramatic loss. Over the next 35 years, researchers predict an additional 45,000 orangutans will be lost.

Albatross breeding success has fallen due to warming air temperatures. Nests built of aerated concrete and mudbrick were placed on Bass Strait’s Albatross Island. On some parts of the island, birds struggle to find enough nesting material for quality natural nests, so scientists created the artificial nests to provide a stable and safe environment for the chicks. Birds with artificial nests have a 20% greater breeding success rate than those with natural nests.

But time-lapse footage of coral bleaching as it happens shows a surprisingly active process. This video, taken by scientists in a laboratory at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, captures a coral ejecting its resident population of algae. The behavior helps corals survive warmer water in the short term, but extended periods of bleaching can be lethal to corals and the ecosystems they support.

The site was first developed as a mining village in 1936, after the Soviets acquired the rights to mine the local coalfields. Although Pyramiden was abandoned in 1998, it remains remarkably well preserved due to the frigid Arctic climate.

Join NG underwater photographer Brian Skerry in the vibrant waters of Cortes Bank and prepare for a sensory overload. ""For me, diving in Cortes Bank is like diving into an underwater kaleidoscope,"" says Skerry. ""It is this fanciful, almost surreal place where green grass sways in a wavelike formation, and what appear to be palm trees are growing out of the seafloor. You’ve got bat rays and stingrays that are feeding down in that surf grass with dolphins overhead. It really is like swimming through the pages of a storybook in a 'Seuss-ical' sort of way, and with every dive you’re meeting this fascinating cast of characters. It’s really quite stunning and unlike anything else I’ve seen.""

Rare northern right whale dolphins, Pacific white-sided dolphins, Pacific torpedo rays, sea lions, and harbor seals are just some of the wildlife that call Cortes Bank home. They elegantly maneuver through the cartoonish sea plants undulating with colors so bright and lively that they may as well have been plucked from the pages of a children's book. But words can’t quite do the exquisite nature of Cortes Bank justice, so Skerry tried to capture it in photographs.

""Cortes Bank has remained somewhat unspoiled due to its remoteness, being a hundred miles offshore of California, and the weather can be quite nasty out there, but Cortes Bank currently has zero protection. So I want to make photographs that will compel readers to first know about this place and then hopefully have a desire to want to protect it,"" Skerry says.

Due to El Niño, Cortes Bank has fallen victim to warming waters. The change in temperature is killing off the region's giant kelp, which is an integral part of a healthy ecosystem for the area’s diverse marine life. As part of National Geographic's film, Sea of Hope, premiering January 15, 2017, Skerry is working with scientists to document rare marine ecosystems in United States waters, highlighting their beauty, wildlife, and need for protection. 

""Being an underwater photographer is quite different than the work that my terrestrial counterparts do. I can't go to a remote place, sit in a blind for a month and use 600 mm lens while waiting for an elusive animal to wander by and make those pictures,"" says Skerry. ""All nature photography is very difficult and has its own unique challenges, but I can only stay underwater as long as the air supply on my back will last. I have to get very close to my subjects, even in the places where the water is the clearest I usually have to make pictures within a couple of meters of my subjects. I have to be able to light them and that is really a testimony to the animals that allow me into their world.""

Skerry has spent some 10,000 hours underwater, bringing images of the marine world back to those of us on land. ""I've been diving for over three decades and I've put myself in some pretty crazy places, but I think having a degree of fear has kept me alive. If the conditions don't seem right or if you're in the presence of an animal that isn't behaving the way you would expect, you get that sort of primal sense and it's important to listen to that and get out of the water. I've been lost under arctic ice, I've been chased by sperm whales or chased out of the water by sharks. I drifted off the coast of Ireland for two and a half hours when the dive boat never saw me and I was picked up ultimately by a fishing boat,"" says Skerry, recounting some of his closer-calls. ""I try to be cautious and listen to that little voice inside of me, and I have no qualms about standing down if a particular day just doesn't seem right, and you live to fight another day.""

""She used to drag me to natural history museums."" President Obama credits his mother for his interest in science and the environment. He added that she'd often wake him in the middle of the night to view particularly spectacular full moons. In an interview on Midway Atoll with National Geographic environment writer Craig Welch, the President reflected on his legacy and how he thinks we should focus efforts to save natural places. This interview came during his trip to Hawaii in early September, 2016, and just days after he expanded the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument surrounding the Hawaiian islands, a pristine expanse of coral reefs and seamounts.

Renowned wildlife photographer Brian Skerry is highly skilled at underwater photography. But, a “once in a lifetime opportunity” to photograph the President while snorkeling near Midway Atoll presented exciting challenges. Days after he expanded the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument surrounding the Hawaiian islands, the President visited the pristine expanse of coral reefs and seamounts and went snorkeling to see the marine life for himself. Skerry reflects on the event and how he used his years of experience to get the unique photograph.

Not surprisingly, the team was eager to go back and learn more, but how do you explore an environment that could easily kill you? You send in robots, of course.

“Our goal is to send instrumentation there to get meaningful data, but sometimes it’s really fun to just blow stuff up,” says National Geographic explorer and ocean engineer Brennan Phillips.

Brennan reunited with his 2015 expedition mates—Alistair Grinham of University of Queensland and Matthew Dunbabin of Queensland University of Technology and Director of GFB Robotics—to once again venture about 20 miles off the coast of the Solomon Islands to the Pacific Ocean’s violent Kavachi volcano.

We talked to Brennan and Matthew about their return to “Sharkcano.”

Q: Why send robots into one of the most active submarine volcanoes on Earth?

Brenna Phillips: Cause it's cool. But also, as a scientist, it's about getting that last data point, right before the eruption—pH, carbon dioxide, temperature fluctuations, acidity. 

Matthew Dunbabin: After looking at a friend’s amazing video of Kavachi’s past eruptions, hearing about the remoteness of the site, and how challenging the conditions are, we were determined to try to get there. This all addresses an interesting problem with monitoring in extreme environments, in that no matter how well-built your systems are or how much they cost, it is very unlikely they will survive an explosion. So, to start increasing our knowledge of these environments you have to develop low-cost monitoring tools that are capable of undertaking meaningful measurements but are not so costly you can’t afford to lose them.

Q: How did you design the robots?

MD:  Kavachi is in a remote part of the Solomon Islands with very limited travel options. So you have to design robots that fit into carry-on luggage on a Twin Otter plane. Also, these robots are considered disposable. Therefore, we are making them as low cost as possible—hundreds of dollars.

BP: In this case we used some used PVC sewer pipe that was found in the village. You just put some electronics onto that and wham-o, you have an autonomous boat.

MD: I like to call it bush robotics.

Q: What did you learn from sending the robots into Kavachi?

MD:  In the vicinity of the vent we found a huge drop in the surface pH levels, water temperatures ten degrees higher than normal, and we learned Kavachi is a strong greenhouse gas emitter. 

Q: How did it feel to discover sharks inside a volcano?

BP: Well, to put my scientist hat on there are a number of reasons why there shouldn't be anything living in there except maybe bacteria. Number one it's very hot and acidic, and we measured that. Number two, it's very turbid, so the water is very cloudy. None of these things are good for fish. Whether they're good for sharks, that's up for debate. Yet we saw sharks that in between eruptions are darting in and out between the clouds of the plume. So that's a lingering question mark.

In the far north of Scotland, an unusual conservation project is underway: the systematic removal of millions of trees. While tearing down forests is generally a bad thing, at the RSPB Forsinard Flows Nature Reserve it is essential to restoring one of the most important ecosystems on the planet. Peatland blanket bogs have been absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere for thousands of years. In this one area of Scotland, the peatlands store an estimated 400 million tons of CO2—which is more than double the amount of CO2 stored in all of the United Kingdom’s forests put together. 

But in the 1980s, tree plantations began buying up the peatlands in order to grow timber. They planted millions of trees and drained the peatlands of water, causing the peat to break apart and release CO2 back into the atmosphere. It’s estimated that losing just 4 percent of the CO2 that is stored in this peatland would equal Scotland’s combined household and industrial carbon emissions. 

Though it will take decades for the peatlands to be fully restored, the team at Forsinard Flows Nature Reserve works year round to do just that.
